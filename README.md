# Thesis LaTeX Template
This template can be used for anything STEM related.

This works for the current version of [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) in combination with [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/).

thesis.tex is the main file which has to be executed. This imports your different sections/chapters, the title page, the declaration of authorship and all of the custom packages of doc_cfg.tex.
